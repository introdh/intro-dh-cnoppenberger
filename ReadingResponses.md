### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
My moment of confusion came with Schulz's "What Is Distant Reading?" when she explains that although Moretti would like to treat literary analysis like a science, it doesn't work out perfectly because literature has been created by humans (and not by nature), so it does not abide by a consistent set of laws. How can we quantify data in literature if what "he perceives inside stories are as imposed as exposed"? Moretti even states in his work *Graphs, Maps, Trees* that "quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations," which Schulz argues is simply not true.

My AHA moment came when Moretti admitted that the history of literature (in this case the relationship between genres and generations) is not exact enough to make perfect predictions or analyses, conceding that "'generation' is itself a very questionable concept." Though this didn't necessarily provide more clarity, it did provide a necessary critique of the practice of distant reading and an explanation of the origin of the defining characteristics of generations.
