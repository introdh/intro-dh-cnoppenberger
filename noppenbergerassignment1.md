## Data Documentation
I chose to collect data on the topic of music because I have always loved music, whether it be alternative, pop, rap, or even heavy metal. However, I noticed that many of my favorite artists were male, and I wondered if that were true for the most popular songs in the general public.
In order to outline gender in popular music, I looked to the American Apple Music Top 30 charts to see what artists and genres are currently popular. In addition to gender, I wanted to take the artists' ages into account as well to see if there were any trends in age as well. For the most part, the artists of the Top 30 songs on Apple Music are 20-something males in the Hip Hop and Rap genre.
Given more time (and patience) I'd love to compare a certain week of Apple Music Top 30 songs with other months, or even years to mark shifts in popular music. Currently, Hip Hop and Rap seems to be enjoying a spotlight, though it wasn't too long ago when Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber topped the charts with their Pop tunes. A study of the shifts in the gender and age of popular artists, or popular genres would provide great insight into the shifts in popular thought and opinion of the public. 
The unifying powers of music make an interesting path through which researchers can study the human condition.
