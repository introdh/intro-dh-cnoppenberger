# Network Analysis of Supreme Court Data

### The Issues
For this network analysis exercise, I chose various Supreme Court issues, organized into certain codes by scholars at Washington University in St. Louis, and created networks of which cases referenced each other as precedent. I compared the issues of Natural Resources: Environmental Protection (code: 80130), National Supremacy: Natural resources (code: 100080), and National Supremacy: Pollution, Air or Water (code: 100090). I was curious to see how much overlap or centrality there would be amongst these variants of environmental law. The codes for each issue were separated, though environmental protection, natural resources, and pollution would seem to go hand in hand. The classification of “National Supremacy” is what seemed to generate the difference in each of these categories of environmental law. 

### The Networks
Unsurprisingly, when I analyzed the “Issues” network, the cases of national supremacy were mixed in with the majority of cases of natural resources. There seemed to be very little distinction between national supremacy cases and natural resource cases, as each kind of case referenced cases from at least one different issue than its own. There were only two national supremacy cases that only referenced other national supremacy cases, *South-Central Timber Development, Inc.* v. *Wunnicke, Commissioner, Department of Natural Resources of Alaska, Et. al* and *Idaho, Et. al* v. *Coeur D’alene Tribe of Idaho, Etc., Et. al*. Even then, the first case references the Department of Natural Resources, indicating that national supremacy and the protection of natural resources cannot be kept as separate issues.

There were also no explicitly "national supremacy" or "natural resources" clusters, highlighting the interdependency of the issues.

The most central cases amongst all of these issues were cases of natural resources, again showing that most national supremacy cases could not be proved without the precedent of natural resource cases.

There was no noticeable correlation between the number of dissenting votes and issues, nor was there a correlation between the year of the case and its issue, indicating no change in support from the court or general popularization of either issue.

### The Problems and Possibilities
From this network analysis, the issues of environmental protection, natural resources, and pollution seem to be almost entirely intertwined, rather than separate as their codes would imply. Though there were some cases that explicitly referenced cases of their own issue, most cases amongst these three issues drew precedent from another issue, showing the complexity of environmental law in general. However, without close reading of each case, it’s very hard to tell exactly how these issues overlap. The citation of past cases as precedent is vital to Supreme Court decisions, as each decision seems to form its own law, depending on how the case goes (Fowler, et. al, Oxford Journals, 2007). But without close reading of each case, we cannot know exactly how that precedent was used in the case, whether it be in support or destruction of a certain argument. Additionally, without close reading, the number of dissenting votes has little meaning when the goal of the case is not immediately known. The Supreme Court Justices could have been voting against environmental protections or against environmental destruction; these networks only tell us how many justices dissented, and it is unclear to what they dissented. Though these network visualizations are extremely helpful at a basic level of understanding, “Context is key, especially in the humanities,” and without context, the actual relationships between these cases and issues are lost (Weingart, JDH, 2011). Though these kinds of networks can provide incredibly helpful visualizations of connections that humanities scholars may not have been able to see before, their usefulness is questionable without proper context and at least some close reading.
