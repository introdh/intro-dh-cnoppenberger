## Georeferencing

In order to build a map of Baltimore’s redlining districts in the 1930’s, we used map images from the University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab’s project, *Mapping Inequality*, as well as census data from the US Census Bureau. We used ArcGIS to georeference our maps and add them to a current roadmap of the world, and in my case, the city of Baltimore. Through ArcGIS I matched points from the image of the 1930’s map to the current roadmap of Baltimore, in order to accurately compare the 1930s map to the current map of Baltimore. These maps are created in order to illustrate the racialized aspects of redlining during the 1930s. These visualizations are not meant to only show the physical space of each neighborhood and street in Baltimore, but also the social, racial, and economical spaces in which citizens of Baltimore lived then and continue to live now. 

Though these maps provide a very clearcut picture of how racial, social, and economic lines defined Baltimore’s neighborhoods during the 1930s, this tool does not prove anything on its own. It is up to researchers, historians, and computer scientists alike to actually do something with these maps. Different interpretations lend different results; even the choice of city, year, source, and number of sources can lead to wildly different conclusions. Amy Hillier provides an excellent example of differing perspectives in her chapter, “Redlining in Philadelphia”. She explains that though the maps seem to indicate that race was the most divisive factor in the loans granted from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, other researchers overlooked the effects of real estate agents and private lenders on the data presented (Hillier, ESRI, March 2002). She argues that Kenneth Jackson’s assertion that redlining was caused by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation has been “elevated… to the status of fact [with] little new evidence to support it,” (Hillier). Through the addition of evidence (a sample of Philadelphia’s mortgage transactions between 1937 and 1950), Hillier came to the conclusion that the relationship between these maps and redlining is not cause and effect, but simply a reflection of real estate practices already in place. Hillier’s critique of the general assumptions of redlining’s origins serves as a reminder that these kinds of evidence and tools cannot stand alone, but require extensive parallel research, contextualization, and most importantly, critique. 

My map of Baltimore asks similar questions to Hillier’s map of Philadelphia, though it lacks her thorough research. Why have certain areas remained underinvested in the past 80 years? Why have some received more or less investment since the 1930s? How much do race, gentrification, white flight, and shifting economies have to do with these changes? What are the differences between qualifications for grading neighborhoods today and in the 1930s? This map simply cannot answer those questions by itself, though it opens new doors to query that would have gone unnoticed, had this map and all of the maps on the *Mapping Inequality* project not existed. Again, these maps are not standalone evidence, but rather they are springboards from which researchers can begin to formulate research questions in order to better understand our society and American cities. 

One way to utilize these maps is in comparison to modern census tracts of household income, education, and race. In Baltimore, there is evidence of newer developments and gentrification, as household incomes are quite high in areas near the Inner Harbor that were graded as “D” areas in the 1930s. Suburban development has also changed the quality of neighborhoods since the 1930s, as “C” and “D” neighborhoods now have higher incomes and higher levels of education. However, much of the “C” and “D” housing in the city (besides gentrified areas) has maintained low incomes, and high unemployment, indicating the disinvestment in some of these areas, even 80 years later. Clearly, neighborhood grades from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation are not the only defining factors of a neighborhood.

This map presents several examples of drawbacks to its representation of space and place. For starters, this map only provides one source of definition of these neighborhoods: the HOLC. While it is necessary to maintain a constant source for one research project, this project cannot stand alone, but rather it should be critiqued and interpreted from a multitude of perspectives. In David Bodenhamer’s terms, these perspectives can take form in different spaces, such as racial or economic spaces, as this map should in part represent conceptual space as well. Unfortunately, due to the initial document sources from the HOLC, we are not able to discern the number of conceptual spaces in which these neighborhoods were graded. Though racial space seems to play a large part in the mapping and grading of these neighborhoods, the data is lacking in clarity, as some parts of the grading forms were simply left blank. And when compared to modern census tracts, these redlining maps are extremely inadequate in determining change in factors like household size, household income, or population crowding. We cannot depend on this map to tell us everything about Baltimore’s housing in the 1930s, as these kinds of maps “are not passive settings but the medium for the development of culture,” (Bodenhamer, The Polis Center, Indiana University, 2013). This map, though a good starting point, is simply incomplete without further critique and research.
