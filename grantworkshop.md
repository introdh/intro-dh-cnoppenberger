# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

How can anecdotal historical trails be documented and included in Patapsco State Park trail maps? Do these anecdotal trails make historical trails more or less accessible? How can we make these trails more acessible?

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

This project attempts to update trail maps for the Patapsco Valley State Park by reviewing current trails and adding new foot trails and anecdotal trails. This new set of trail maps would be used to reach many of Maryland's famous historical sites that have been hidden in the state's parks, only to be found through trails that don't exist on standard roadmaps or trailmaps. This project would utilize GIS technology and textual analysis of hiking and historical blogs to mark these anecdotal trails and make them more accessible for historians and hikers alike. Through the use of GIS technology, historical maps of the area would be compared to modern maps in order to uncover the relative location of these historical towns and sites, as compared to our modern road and trail maps, in order to make historical research of these areas more accessible. 

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in
