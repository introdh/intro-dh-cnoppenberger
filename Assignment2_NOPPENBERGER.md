### Written Response

The data I chose to topic model is the complete journal of Family Planning Perspectives, a collection of research from the United States and other countries on the subject of family planning, from 1969 to 2001. This data would be considered string data, as topic modeling analyzes strings of words and their relative frequencies. I chose to form only 18 topics because after first running the program with 25 topics, many of the topics seemed to overlap to the point where they were indistinguishable from each other. Topics such as abortion and healthcare were especially common, so in an attempt to condense the number of topics and bring similar topics together, I changed the number to 18 topics. This helped bring some specificity to the more common topics as well, as specific groupings like Abortion Law and Federal Healthcare formed, instead of incomplete or repetitive topics. 

These topics give us insight into the more popular research from 1969 to 2001 on family planning, spanning subjects from abortion to family health and wellbeing. Even after reducing the number of topics, abortion still played a large part in the overall collection of research in Family Planning Perspectives, as well as healthcare, health risks in all aspects of family planning, and STIs. Some specific years also frequently appeared in the topics, indicating important years for legislation, fertility, or new developments in research, enough to constitute a topic based solely on the 1970s (Fertility and Contraception in the 1970s). These formative years show the linear trends in research and legislation, especially following the landmark Roe v. Wade decision of 1973. Other topics based on data (as this is a research journal, after all) created categories of trends as well, consolidating articles specifically on the subject of data trends into two topics (Data Analysis and Data Trends). The general theme of the topics indicates the journal’s scientific and research-based nature as well, as most of the topics include terms such as “data”, “research”, “percent”, or “risk”. 

Some of the limitations of this topic model include the size of the corpus and the overlap amongst topics. These 32 years of Family Planning Perspectives comprise a relatively small corpus, excluding more specific topics. Even with a larger number of topics, the model gained little specificity, as so much of the journal was focused on health, contraception, and abortion. As Ted Underwood points out, these topics are simply based on relative frequencies, so without close reading, there is no certainty that the topics are perfectly aligned (Underwood, blog, 04–07-2012). Without the time-consuming practice of close reading, it would be very difficult to find more specific topics within an already relatively niche research journal. Scott Weingart and Elijah Meeks even go so far as to caution scholars against topic modeling as it is a “false security of having resolved the distinction between a word and the thing that it represents,” (Weingart and Meeks, JDH, 2012). With this in mind, this topic model of Family Planning Perspectives should not be used as a source of information by itself, but rather as an organizational tool to read deeper into the various topics and subjects that comprise the journal. This model would prove to be an incredibly useful tool to narrow research topics and organize the 32 years of Family Planning Perspectives, though these generalized topics should not be taken as a representation of the whole.
